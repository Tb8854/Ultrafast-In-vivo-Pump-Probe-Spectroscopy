# Ultrafast-In-vivo-Pump-Probe-Spectroscopy
Code and data to reproduce figures and content for Ultrafast In vivo Pump Probe Spectroscopy

Within BioTADA_Examples is a self contained Mathematica notebook which develops 

1. Imports Cell, PSI and PSII data
2. Creates Sequential, Moving, Branched and Arbitrary Model Datasets
3. SVD and GA examples and implemntations for the above.
4. LDA (Lifetime Density Analysis) for the above.
5. Comparment Analysis Examples
6. Other more advanced examples.

The other files replicate the images in the paper, and use the functions in the BioTada_Examples worksheet.
